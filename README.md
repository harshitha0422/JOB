# dragAndDrop.py

The provided code is a PyQt5 application for measuring and comparing volumes of STL files representing 3D models of teeth. The application allows users to drag and drop either a single STL file or a folder containing multiple STL files. It calculates and displays the volumes of the dropped STL files and enables the comparison of pre-treatment and post-treatment volumes for different teeth.

Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionality of the code:

Imports: The code starts by importing necessary modules, including PyQt5 widgets, STLUtils for volume measurement, and CSV for data storage.

DragDropWidget class: This class represents a widget that allows users to drag and drop either an STL file or a folder. It shows the name of the dropped file or folder and calculates its volume using STLUtils. If both folders are selected, it calls the function calculate_singe_numbered_tooth_in_a_folder, which processes the files in both folders and stores the results in a CSV file.

MyApp class: This class is the main application window and contains two DragDropWidget instances. It also has a QLabel and a QTableWidget to display volume information. The checkBothFoldersSelected function is called to check if both folders are selected and trigger volume calculation and CSV file loading accordingly.

CSV Data Loading: The load_csv function reads the data from the CSV file and displays it in the QTableWidget. It resizes the columns based on the table width to ensure proper visualization.

Application Setup and Execution: The main block sets up the QApplication and initializes the main window (MyApp instance). It also sets the font style and stylesheet for consistent UI appearance.

Execution: The application is executed using app.exec_().

The main functionality of the application is driven by the DragDropWidget class, which handles the drag and drop events and measures the volumes of the dropped STL files. The MyApp class organizes the overall UI layout and data visualization.

Overall, the application provides a simple and user-friendly way to measure and compare volumes of 3D models, making it useful for dental or medical applications that involve STL files of teeth or other objects.
